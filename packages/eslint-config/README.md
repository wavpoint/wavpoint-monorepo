# Wavpoint ESLint Config

This package contains the shared [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration for the Wavpoint monorepo.

## Status

We plan on phasing out ESLint in favor of [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/), as it is a very well-rounded package for formatting, linting, and more.

## Usage

This configuration is automatically applied to all packages and apps in the monorepo.

If you need to extend or modify the ESLint configuration, edit the files in this package.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [main README](../../README.md).
